# SQL Practice Repository

This repository is a way to strengthen my skills in making sql queries from [sql-practice.com](https://www.sql-practice.com/) website. Below I have links to two databases, where you can see the databases' schemas and questions with answers.

### Databases:

- [Hospital](Hospital/README.md)
- [Northwind](Northwind/README.md)
